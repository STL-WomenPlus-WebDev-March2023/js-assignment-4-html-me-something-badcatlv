            <h2>The Beginning of the Journey</h2>
            <a name="theBeginning"></a>
            <p>Growing up in the Blake family it was expected for our dad to have a project. From gardening, to wood
               working, &amp; sometimes an ametuer mechanic of british sports cars. He owned 1974 Spitfire Triumph when
               I was younger, using my older siblings as free labor. I missed the oppurtunity to work on the car with
               him because by the time I was old enough to be trusted with tools he had sold it. <br />In the spring of
               2022, in passing, he talked about wanting to take on another car project. By the end of summer he had
               bought as 1965 Spitfire Triumph from a barn Iowa, by way of North Dakota, originally from who knows. The
               last time it was legal for the road was 1985. </p>

            <a name="theMiddle"></a>
            <p>We spent fall &amp; winter 2022, &amp; into the psirng working on the front and rear suspension, removing
               and reinstalling the differential, new radiator, new distributor, tuned to carbs, and so forth. The
               company originally made tractor engines, so these engines are basically glorified tractor engines. The
               wiring was Lucas, knicknamed 'The Prince of Darkness' because how often his wiring failed. However, we
               lucked out and the wiring was difficult to figure out but not impossible. </p>

            <p>This May we started to reach the end. We still need to install new seats, and finishing touched, but it
               is up and running, and for the first time in 38 years legally licensed.</p>

            <p>The best part is taking it on the road. It's kind of an awkard car but I am hoping to learn manual on it this fall.</p>
